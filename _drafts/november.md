Several conferences of possible interest to SIAG-LA members were
announced this month on the SIAG-LA digest and NA-digest, including:

- [Domain Decomposition 23][1] in July 2015

Also: the [Gene Golub SIAM Summer School on RandNLA][2] in June 2015 is now
accepting applications.  The application deadline is February 1, 2015.
And don't forget that there is a [call for proposals for the next G2S3][3]
out (letter of intent due January 31, 2015)!

Possibly interesting items from the web at large:

- George Dantzig (Nov 8 1914-May 13, 2005) of linear programming fame 
  would have turned 100 this month.  
  A [session in his honor][dantzig] was held at this month's
  INFORMS annual meeting in San Francisco.
- SIAM fall elections closed, and we [have a new board and council][siamnew].
