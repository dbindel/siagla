Several conferences of possible interest to SIAG-LA members were
announced this month on the SIAG-LA digest and NA-digest, including:

- Workshop on [Mining Networks and Graphs][1] in April 2015
- [26th Biennial Numerical Analysis Conference][3] in June 2015
  (second announcement)
- [PASC15][7] in June 2015
- [SIAM Control and Applications][4] in July 2015 -- upcoming CFP
  deadline
- In the context of the
  [CIMI semester on "High performance linear and nonlinear methods for large scale applications"][cimi],
  there are calls open for
  [Sparse Days in St. Girons III][5] in June 2015,
  a workshop on
  [Low-Rank Approximation for High Performance Sparse Solvers][2] in June 2015
  and a workshop on [Innovative Clustering Methods][6] in July 2015

[SIAG/LA prize nominations][prize] are due February 15, 2015!  Also, the [Gene
Golub SIAM Summer School on RandNLA][randnla] in June 2015 is now accepting
applications (deadline is February 1, 2015), and there is a [call for proposals
for the next G2S3][g2s3call] out (letter of intent due January 31, 2015).
