The 3rd SIAM Workshop on Network Science 2015 will be held on May 16-17, 2015,
at Snowbid UT. Submissions are welcome on all aspects of rigorous computational
and mathematical techniques involved in network analysis, with a particular
interest in contributions in the following areas:

- dynamic processes on networks and especially epidemic spreading models
- higher order network analysis including topological and geometric
  methods for networks
- applications to infrastructure and computer security networks

It will be co-located with the SIAM Conference on Applications of
Dynamical Systems 2015.

The deadline for submissions is Jan 10.
