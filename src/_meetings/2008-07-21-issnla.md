The first ISSNLA took place in Spain in 2008, where it was
held in cooperation with [SIMUMAT][1] (Mathematical Modeling and
Numerical Simulation in Science and Technology) and took the form of
the SIAG/LA-SIMUMAT International Summer School in Numerical Linear
Algebra.  Four courses were given during the school:

 - Krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems,
   _Michael Eiermann, Institut f&#252;r Numerische Mathematik und Optimierung,
   Technische Universit&#228;t Bergakademie Freiberg_
 - Matrix methods in data mining,
   _Lars Eld&#233;n, Department of Mathematics, Link&#246;ping University_
 - Mechanics and linear algebra,
   _Richard B. Lehoucq, Sandia National Laboratories_
 - Structured eigenvalue problems: modern theory and computational practice,
   _David S. Watkins, Department of Mathematics, Washington State University_

A [report on the 2008 Summer School (PDF, 89K)][2] is available.

Local organizing committee:

 - Blanca Ayuso
 - Miguel Angel Ben&#237;tez
 - Froil&#225;n M. Dopico
 - Alberto Ibort
 - Juan Manuel Molera
