We are pleased to announce that the 26th Biennial Conference on
Numerical Analysis will take place June 23-26, 2015 at the University
of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. The conference is open to all
researchers in the field, and we hope that less-experienced
researchers and PhD students will find the environment particularly
welcoming.

We are currently soliciting proposals for mini-symposia in any branch
of Numerical Analysis or a cognate area. If you are interested in
organising a minisymposium, please contact the conference committee at
naconf@strath.ac.uk. Our online registration process will open
shortly, after which we will also welcome proposals for individual
contributed talks.

The following distinguished researchers have accepted invitations for
delivering plenary lectures: Susanne Brenner (Louisiana State
University), Albert Cohen (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie), Charlie
Elliot (University of Warwick), Martin Gander (Universite de Geneve),
Mike Giles (University of Oxford), Jan Hesthaven (EPFL), Tamara Kolda
(Sandia National Laboratories), Christian Lubich (Universitat
Tubingen), Cleve Moler (Mathworks), Michael Saunders (Stanford
University), Rob Scheichl (University of Bath), Karen Willcox (MIT).

Further information may be found at http://www.naconf.org.uk

Please note that the meeting will be preceded by the 17th IMA Leslie
Fox Prize presentations, which will take place at the University of
Strathclyde on Monday June 22nd, 2015.
