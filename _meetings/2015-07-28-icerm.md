The goal of this workshop is to bring together mathematicians and data
scientists to participate in a discussion of current methods and
outstanding problems in data science.  The workshop is particularly
aimed at mathematicians interested in pursuing research or a career in
data science who wish to gain an understanding of this rapidly
evolving field and the ways in which mathematics can
contribute. Researchers currently working in data science are also
encouraged to attend, to share ideas about mathematical methodologies
and challenges. A number of experienced data scientists with a variety
of backgrounds from academics, national laboratories, and industry
(including startups) will be invited.  The program will include
overview and technical talks, several panels consisting of
practitioners with different experience levels, and one or more poster
sessions.

Hosted by the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in
Mathematics (ICERM) located at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.
