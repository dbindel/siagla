The 21st Industrial Mathematical & Statistical Modeling (IMSM) Workshop 
for Graduate Students will take place at North Carolina State 
University, 13-22 July 2015.  The workshop is sponsored by the 
Statistical and Applied Mathematical Science Institute (SAMSI) together 
with the Center for Research in Scientific Computation (CRSC) and the 
Department of Mathematics at North Carolina State University.

The IMSM workshop exposes graduate students in mathematics, engineering, 
and statistics to exciting real-world problems from industry and
government. The workshop provides students with experience in a research 
team environment and exposure to possible career opportunities. On the 
first day, a Software Carpentry boot camp  will bring students 
up-to-date on their programming skills in Python/Matlab and R, and 
introduce them to version control systems and software repositories.

Local expenses and travel expenses will be covered for students at US 
institutions. The application deadline is 15 April 2015. Information is 
available at <http://www.samsi.info/IMSM15> and questions can be directed 
to <grad@samsi.info>.
