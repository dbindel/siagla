EUCCO 2018 - deadline for contributions is extended to June 15.

We would like to draw your attention to the 5th European Conference on Computational Optimization - EUCCO 2018, taking place in Trier in from September 10 - 12, 2018.

The scope of this conference series is quite broad as it aims to bring together scientists from a diversity of subdisciplines, such as computational optimization, algorithms and applications. The upcoming conference will place special emphasis on certain aspects of optimization, found in the focus sessions, while still keeping its more traditional focus on large scale optimization, optimization with partial differential equations, and numerical optimization algorithms and software.

Registration is still open!
