*Gene Golub SIAM Summer School*.  Four courses
were given during the two week school:

 - Minimizing communication in numerical linear algebra, 
   _James Demmel, University of California at Berkeley, USA_
 - Nonlinear eigenvalue problems: analysis and numerical solution,
   _Volker Mehrmann, Technische Universitaet Berlin, Germany_
 - From Matrix to Tensor: The Transition to Computational Multilinear Algebra,
   _Charles Van Loan, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA_
 - Linear Algebra and Optimization,
   _Margaret H. Wright, Courant Institute, New York University, USA_

SIAM News (December 2010) featured a [report on the 2010 Summer School][1].
