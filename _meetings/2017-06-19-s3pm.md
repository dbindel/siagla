The Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling 2017 (SPM-2017) will be co-located in Berkeley, California with Shape Modeling International (SMI) as part of the International Convention on Shape, Solid, Structure & Physical Modeling (S3PM-2017) (<https://s3pm.icsi.berkeley.edu/s3pm/>).

SPM seeks high quality, original research contributions that strive to advance all aspects of geometric and physical modeling, and their application in design, analysis and manufacturing, as well as in biomedical, geophysical, digital entertainment, and other areas.  The symposium is organized with the support of the Solid Modeling Association (SMA), which will award the 2017 Pierre B&eacute;zier Prize for contributions to solid, shape, and physical modeling during the conference.

Accepted full-length papers will be published as a journal special issue in Computer-Aided Design (Elsevier).

###UPDATES

* NEW! The [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/) has provided funding (pending final processing) to support registration and travel for a limited number of students from US educational institutions or US citizens who are graduate students in universities outside of the US.  
   * Instructions for application will be posted soon.  
* There will be a joint poster session between SPM and SMI. You can submit proposals for posters before May 5th.  
   * [Click here to submit poster abstracts to SPM-2017](https://s3pm.icsi.berkeley.edu/s3pm/spm.html#poster).  
   * [Click here to submit poster abstracts to SMI-2017](https://s3pm.icsi.berkeley.edu/s3pm/smi.html#poster).  
* The SPM and SMI paper submission rounds are over. However, researchers and practitioners are welcome to submit relevant papers to the Fabrication and Sculpting Event (FASE) before May 15th.  
   * [Click here to submit full papers to FASE-2017](https://s3pm.icsi.berkeley.edu/s3pm/fase.html#submit).  
   * [Click here for more information about mini-symposia](https://s3pm.icsi.berkeley.edu/s3pm/index.html#mini).   
* The early registration (offering $100 discount for all registrations) is available until May 17th.  
   * [**CLICK HERE TO REGISTER NOW**](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3343403/S3PM-2017-Registration)!
* The Convention venue is the **Banatao Auditorium** at UC Berkeley.  
* A Block of rooms is reserved for the guests in Hotel Shattuck Plaza near the convention venue. Group rates are available until the block sells out and before **May 17th**, whichever comes first. The other reserved block (Bancroft Hotel) is already sold out. We are working to explore alternative lodging options.  
   * [Click here to learn more about venue and lodging](https://s3pm.icsi.berkeley.edu/s3pm/#location).  
* We have three confirmed keynote speakers so far: **Hao Li**, **Kristina Shea**, and **Jonathan R. Shewchuk** will talk about new frontiers for S3PM!
   * [Click here to learn more about keynote speeches](https://s3pm.icsi.berkeley.edu/s3pm/index.html#speakers).  
* So far, we have five financial sponsors supporting S3PM: [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) (Gold), [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home.html) (Gold), [PARC](https://www.parc.com/) (Gold), [University of Wisconsin](http://www.wisc.edu/) (Gold), and [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/) (Silver).
