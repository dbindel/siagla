The Chairs of the Convention are inviting proposals for a small number of Mini-Symposia focused on emerging topics of high impact on the research and industrial communities.
​ ​ 
We are inviting you to consider submitting a proposal and chairing it, if accepted. A mini-symposium will include 3 presentations (20 mins each) by the Chair and 2 invited speakers, or a brief introduction by the Chair and presentations by 3 invited speakers, followed by a panel and Q&A discussion.
​ ​ 
The proposal should be submitted before January 30, 2017 and should include:  
 * Title of the mini-symposium,
 * Name, affiliation, and homepage link of the Chair,
 * List of speakers’ names with their affiliations and homepage links,
 * Brief outline and motivation for the importance of the topic,
 * For each presentation:
    * Title of the presentation,
    * Speaker’s name,
    * Short abstract (about 200 words),
    * Link to the most relevant paper.
​ ​ 
Feel free to get in touch with any of us if you have a question. We look forward to hearing from you and seeing you at S3PM-2017 in June.
