This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in the
field to deal with the emerging challenges in processing and mining
large-scale networks. Such networks can be directed as well as
undirected, they can be labeled or unlabeled, weighted or unweighted,
and static or dynamic. Networks of networks are also of
interest. Specific scientific topics of interest for this meeting
include mining for patterns of interest in networks, efficient
algorithms (sequential/parallel, exact/approximation) for analyzing
network properties, methods for processing large networks (i.e.,
Map-Reduce and Giraph based frameworks), use of linear algebra and
numerical analysis for mining complex networks, database techniques
for processing networks, and fusion of heterogeneous data sources into
graphs. Another particular topic of interest is to couple structural
properties of networks to the dynamics over networks, e.g.,
contagions.

The full-day workshop will feature: 2 invited talks, a session to
showcase tools and systems individuals have developed in this area,
contributed talks, and a short session on open problems and directions
for future research. Papers that describe original and ongoing
research as well as those that describe systems and tools are
solicited.

Important Dates:
