The use of computational methods to treat mathematical models in
science and engineering is widespread. Such models often involve PDEs,
and the efficiency of these algorithms on modern high performance
computing systems relies on the ability to parallelize the
computations. The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction
to the state of the art in theory and practical applications of domain
decomposition (DD) methods for PDEs.

The program will begin with a two-day short course given by
Prof. Martin Gander (Geneva). Prof. Gander is an internationally
recognized leading expert in Schwarz methods - a class of DD methods
for steady state and time dependent PDEs.  The middle component of the
program will focus on presentations by researchers whose work may
benefit from the use of DD methods for PDEs arising as mathematical
models in practical applications. The final segment of the program
will feature a workshop format in which breakout teams will
investigate the process of introducing DD techniques into the
numerical simulations that arise in the applications identified
earlier.

Confirmed DD experts include David Keyes (KAUST), Victorita Dolean
(Nice) and Felix Kwok (Hong Kong Baptist).

Some funding for students will be available. More information and
registration details will appear shortly at
