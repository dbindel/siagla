In the context of the CIMI Semester on "High performance linear and
nonlinear methods for large scale applications", a workshop on
"Innovative clustering methods for large graphsand block methods" will
be held in Toulouse, France, from 6th to 8th July 2015.

The format that we plan for the workshop is for a few short
presentations, on the topics of the day, leaving a lot of time for
exchanges and discussions amongst participants.  The central theme of
the workshop is to investigate clustering techniques in the context of
very large and sparse matrices, and the use of HPC to design efficient
algorithms.

Over the three days of this workshop, the foci we plan for each day
are: the first day will be on applications, describing various
disciplines that can benefit from clustering, and what type of
structure identification can be of interest depending on the
application; this can for instance address the use of specific block
structures in large linear system solvers, clustering in graphs with
applications, and pattern recognition using numerical structure; the
second day will focus on tools and kernels useful for clustering
algorithms, such as scaling, graph reordering techniques, and spectral
analysis; the last day will be devoted to tools for model reduction,
including for instance non-negative factorization techniques and rank
reduction techniques.

There are no registration fees for the workshop, but there is a limit
on the number of participants that can be accommodated. Expressions
of interest to attend or proposals (in the form of a one page
abstract) for a short 20mn talk, should be sent by January 31st 2015,
to either Daniel Ruiz or Sandrine Mouysset at IRIT
(daniel.ruiz@irit.fr or sandrine.mouysset@irit.fr), from whom further
information can be obtained.  Notifications of acceptance will be
given by March 1st 2015.

A session of the conference ["Sparse days in St Girons III"][sparse]
(29/06/2015-02/06/2015) will be dedicated to the topics of this
workshop, and people interested in this area might also wish to attend
the conference. Full details of how to register for the conference are
available from the web page <http://www.cimi-semester-hpc.fr>.
