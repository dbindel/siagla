### SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE

PASC15 Conference is inviting researchers from diverse scientific background to
promote interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange of expertise in HPC and
computational science. The conference is an opportunity for researchers and
practitioners in branches of science that require computer modeling and
high-performance simulations to discuss computational techniques and
technologies. PASC15 Conference seeks to engage participants from the academia,
research labs and industry to address important issues in HPC and computational
science resulting from applications of interest to society and hardware
innovations.

### OFFERING

PASC15 Conference will offer four plenary sessions, one public lecture, 24 mini
symposia with each up to eight talks, 80 contributed talks, one inter-PASC
Networks discussion, one joint plenary session with the satellite conference
Frontiers in Computational Physics
(<http://www.frontiersincomputationalphysics.com>), a poster session, and
information stands.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Researchers from the academic and from the corporate world are encouraged to
participate and present their research area in the form of minisymposia,
contributed talks and/or poster presentations. PASC15 welcomes submissions in
the following scientific fields:

 - Climate and Weather
