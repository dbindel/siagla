Dear colleagues,

The annual Sparse Days meeting will be held at Cerfacs in Toulouse on
27th and 28th September 2018.

Registration for the Sparse Days is free but we ask people who are
coming to register as soon as possible although the deadline is August
26th. Please complete the form on the website
<https://sparsedays.cerfacs.fr/en/> indicating whether you want to give
a talk and whether you wish to attend the conference dinner. Although
an emphasis will be on parallel aspects, any talk that has an
association with sparsity is welcome. The length for a talk plus
questions is 30 minutes although this is negotiable in either
direction.

Information on accommodation can be found on the web page and a
limited amount of free on site accommodation should be available for
students. Students wanting to apply for this accommodation should
contact Brigitte Yzel on yzel@cerfacs.fr.

Best wishes

Iain Duff
