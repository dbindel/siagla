The DR17 workshop brings together researchers across mathematics, statistics, and engineering to explore a range of emerging techniques for parameter space dimension reduction. Topics of interest include:  

* active subspaces  
* basis adaptation  
* inverse regression  
* sufficient dimension reduction  
* sloppy models  
* sensitivity analysis  
* ridge recovery and approximation  
* deterministic and statistical parameter estimation  
* applications with science and engineering simulations or data sets  

Plenary speakers:  
Francesca Chiaromonte, Penn State University  
Mark Transtrum, Brigham Young University  

The submission deadline is February 27. Submitted abstracts will be considered for a 20-minute presentation or poster. More details on the website:
