The 24th Industrial Mathematical & Statistical Modeling (IMSM) Workshop for
Graduate Students will take place at North Carolina State University,
between 15-25 July 2018.  The workshop is sponsored by the Statistical and
Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) together with the Center
for Research in Scientific Computation (CRSC) and the Department of
Mathematics at North Carolina State University.

The IMSM workshop exposes graduate students in mathematics, engineering,
and statistics to exciting real-world problems from industry and
government. The workshop provides students with experience in a research
team environment and exposure to possible career opportunities. On the
first day, a Software Carpentry bootcamp will bring students up-to-date on
their programming skills in Python/Matlab and R, and introduce them to
version control systems and software repositories.

Local expenses and travel expenses will be covered for students at US 
institutions.  
The application deadline is April 15, 2018.  
Information is available at <http://www.samsi.info/imsm-18>  
and questions can be directed to <grad@samsi.info>  

With best regards,
