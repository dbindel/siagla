Advanced topics in MHD, June 11-15 (2018)  

**Lecturers:**  

- David MacTaggart (Glasgow)  
- Andrew Hillier (Exeter)  
- Anthony Yeates (Durham)   
- Elena Khomenko (IAC)   
- Etienne Pariat (Meudon)   
- Nobumitsu Yokoi (Tokyo)  

**Theme**  
In this school we will study MHD stability theory, magnetic topology, MHD turbulence, magnetic reconnection and how all of these areas are connected in astrophysical and laboratory applications. Our treatment of these topics will go beyond what is normally presented in textbooks (hence the "Advanced" in the title).

This course is ideal for PhD students and postdocs working in MHD and will take place in the beautiful renaissance palace of [CISM](http://www.cism.it/) (Udine, Italy). PhD students can count the school towards course credits required for their doctorates.
