We are excited to invite you to the PETSc 20th anniversary workshop
and tutorial during June 15-18, 2015 at Argonne National Laboratory. 
The conference announcement and registration information can be

Thanks to the generosity of the Computing, Environment, and Life 
Sciences (CELS) directorate of Argonne, there are no registration fees, 
and we can provide some travel support for students, post-docs and 
those with limited travel budgets. Please register soon so we can 
include you in the program.
