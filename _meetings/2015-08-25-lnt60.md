Nick Trefethen is well-known for his work in approximation theory,
pseudospectra, numerical linear algebra, and numerical complex
analysis. The meeting will be an opportunity to celebrate his
significant research contributions on his 60th birthday. The
conference has a broad theme of new developments in all areas of
numerical computation, with a special theme of algorithms for
numerical computation with functions.
