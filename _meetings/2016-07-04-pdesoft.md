PDESoft provides a forum for the developers and users of open 
source tools solving the diverse stages of the numerical PDE 
process to exchange the latest developments and discuss future ideas.

PDESoft 2016 will be held at the University of Warwick, UK. 
The main conference will run from July 4 to 6, while July 7 and 8 
are dedicated to coding days, where developers can work on joint projects.
We are happy to announce that Chris Cantwell, Stéphanie Chaillat-Loseille, 
Katy Huff, and Andreas Klöckner agreed to give keynote talks.

The call for abstracts has been extended until April 8th:

template provided on the conference web page.
If you would like to suggest a group or a topic for the coding days please 
contact the organisers.

Thanks to the support of London Mathematical Society, registration is now 
free for PhD students (£100 for other participants) and support for 
accommodation is available upon request.
