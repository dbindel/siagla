The conference Sparse Days in St Girons III will be held in St Girons
near Toulouse from 29 June to 2 July 2015. Previous conferences were
held in 1994 and 2003 and a similar pattern will be followed for this
meeting.

There will be sessions on the themes of the CIMI Semester workshops,
viz. low-rank approximations for high performance sparse solvers,
innovative clustering methods for large graphs and block methods,
parallel methods for time dependent problems, and advances in
optimization with application to data assimilation.  Further
information on these can be obtained from other pages on the website
(<http://cimi-semester-hpc.fr/>).

You are invited to attend or to give a talk on any area relevant to
the title of the conference on topics not necessarily related to the
workshops. There will also be poster sessions.

The conference general chairs are Jim Demmel (Berkeley), Jack Dongarra
(Tennessee and Manchester), Iain Duff (CERFACS and RAL), and Patrick
Amestoy (INPT-IRIT, Toulouse). The local organizer chair is
Pierre-Henri Cros (IRIT).
