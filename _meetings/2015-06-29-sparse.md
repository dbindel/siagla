This is to announce that there will be a sparse days conference in St
Girons, Ariege, France (one hour from Toulouse) from 29th June to 2nd
July 2015.

This conference can be thought of as a sequel to the meetings in St
Girons in 1994 and 2003 and will be held in the context of a CIMI
funded semester that includes four workshops and the conference.

Because this is a longer and larger event, there will be no Sparse
Days at CERFACS next year.

There will shortly be more information about both the conference and
the workshops.
