The 2019 International Conference on Preconditioning Techniques
for Scientific and Industrial Applications (Preconditioning 2019) 

Date: July 1 -- 3, 2019

Location: University of Minnesota, Twin cities

Preconditioning 2019  is the  11th edition of  the series  of meetings
(one every two  years) that address issues  related to preconditioning
methods  for solving  general  sparse matrix  problems in  large-scale
applications and in industrial settings. The conference is a forum for
exchanging  ideas  on  the   latest  developments  in  preconditioning
techniques for  sparse linear  systems of equations,  and to  a lesser
extent for  eigenvalue problems.   Preconditioning 2019 will  mark the
20th anniversary of this series of conferences which started in 1999 at
the University of Minnesota.

Additional  details,  including  the  list of  invited  speakers,  the
scientific  committee,  and  important  dates, can  be  found  at  the
conference web-site:
