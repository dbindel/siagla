Structured matrices and tensors occur in many disciplines in applied
mathematics and engineering. Fast algorithms for structured matrices
and tensors are of particular importance in data analysis, and signal
and image processing. This conference has two major objectives. One,
we want to improve the dialogue and collaboration between matrix and
tensor theoreticians and the computational scientists. Two, we want to
reduce the gap between the researchers working on the fundamentals and
those working on real-life applications, so that emerging applications
will stimulate new theoretical research and the better theoretical
tools will in turn be exported back to the various application fields.

Registration is free, but must be submitted before November 20, 2014.
