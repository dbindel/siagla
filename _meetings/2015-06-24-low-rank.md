In the context of the CIMI Semester on "High performance linear and
nonlinear methods for large scale applications", a workshop on
"Low-rank approximations for high performance sparse solvers" will be
held in Toulouse, France, from 24th to 26th June 2015. The objective
of the workshop is to gather a limited number of people sharing an
interest on this topic and to foster discussions and collaborations.

There are no registration fees for the workshop but interested
participants are asked to propose a contribution to the workshop in
the form of an abstract for a 30 minutes presentation by December 31st
2014. Notifications of acceptance will be given by January 31st 2015.
Full details of how to register are available from the web page
<http://www.cimi-semester-hpc.fr>.

A session of the conference "Sparse days in St Girons III"
(29/06/2015-02/06/2015) will also be dedicated to low-rank
approximation issues and people interested in this topic are welcome
attend the conference.
