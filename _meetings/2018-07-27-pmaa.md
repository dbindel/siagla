10th INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON 
PARALLEL MATRIX ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS (PMAA'18) 

Jun 27-29, 2018, Zurich, Switzerland.  <http://pmaa18.ethz.ch/>

This international workshop aims to be a forum for exchanging ideas, insights and experiences in different areas of parallel computing in which matrix algorithms play a key role.  The Workshop will bring together experts and practitioners from diverse disciplines with a common interest in matrix computation.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Parallel methods for solving large sparse or dense linear systems of equations and eigenvalue problem
* Parallel environments and tools for enabling matrix applications.
* Large scale applications from any field that have an emphasis on parallel matrix computation
* Novel architectural paradigms (e.g. GPU, MIC, etc.)
* Hybrid approaches to parallel programming
* Automatic tuning and performance modeling
* Combinatorial Scientific Computing

Invited speakers: Chao Yang (Lawrence Berkeley NL), Inderjit Dhillon (UT Austin), Frederic Nataf (UPMC Paris), Edgar Solomonik (UI Urbana-Champaign).

Co-chairs: Peter Arbenz (ETH Zurich, Rolf Krause (USI Lugano), Daniel Kressner (EPF Lausanne), Olaf Schenk (USI Lugano).

Important dates:

- March 15, 2018: Submission of Minisymposium proposals by e-mail to
<pmaa18@ethz.ch>  
- March 30, 2018: Submission of abstracts for MS and contributed talks
