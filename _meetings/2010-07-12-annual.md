SIAG/LA organized a linear algebra "track" at the 2010 Annual Meeting.
A "track" is a part of the program that is devoted to a particular
field, in this case linear algebra. It consists of at least one
invited topical speaker, four to six minisymposia, and contributed
sessions spread out over two days.
