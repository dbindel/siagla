Purdue CCAM (Center for Computational & Applied Mathematics) is hosting the 2018 Conference on Fast Direct Solvers on Nov 9-11, 2018 (it will start from the afternoon of Fri, Nov 9). The purpose of the conference is to discuss and exchange ideas on topics related to fast direct solvers, structured matrices, sparsity and data sparsity, high performance direct solvers, randomized algorithms, structured preconditioning, fast PDE and IE solvers, related applications, and other relevant subjects. The organizers are Jie Shen and Jianlin Xia.

 The following is a tentative list of invited speakers:

 - Eric Darve, Stanford University  
 - Ming Gu, UC Berkeley  
 - Daniel Kressner, EPFL, Switzerland  
 - Sabine Le Borne, Hamburg University of Technology, Germany  
 - Eric Michielssen, University of Michigan  
 - Olaf Schenk, Universita della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland
