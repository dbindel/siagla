The 22nd Industrial Mathematical & Statistical Modeling (IMSM) Workshop for Graduate Students will take place at North Carolina State University, 17-27 July 2016.  The workshop is sponsored by the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Science Institute (SAMSI) together with the Center for Research in Scientific Computation (CRSC) and the Department of Mathematics at North Carolina State University.

The IMSM workshop exposes graduate students in mathematics,
engineering, and statistics to exciting real-world problems from industry and government. The workshop provides students with experience in a research team environment and exposure to possible career opportunities. On the first day, a Software Carpentry bootcamp will bring students up-to-date on their programming skills in Python/Matlab and R, and introduce them to version control systems and software repositories.

Local expenses and travel expenses will be covered for students at US institutions. The application deadline is 15 May 2016. Information is available at <http://www.samsi.info/IMSM16> and questions can be directed to <grad@samsi.info>
