4rd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATRIX METHODS IN MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATIONS  
August 24 - 28, 2015, Moscow, Russia  

For participation and talk submission, use the conference website:  
<http://matrix.inm.ras.ru/mmma-2015/>

Organizing committee: Dario Bini (University of Pisa), Alexander
Guterman (MSU), Ivan Oseledets (Skoltech), Denis Zorin (Courant
Institute of Mathematics), Eugene Tyrtyshnikov (INM-MSU, chair)

Main topics include different areas in linear algebra and its
applications with an accent on new trends in linear algebra and
computational technologies.

We plan to have plenary talks and three (maybe parallel) sessions: (1)
MATRICES AND ALGEBRA; (2) MATRICES AND ALGORITHMS; (3) MATRICES AND
APPLICATIONS
