This conference is a sequel to eight successful "preconditioning"
biennial meetings which address complex issues related to the solution
of general sparse matrix problems in large-scale applications and in
industrial settings. The goal of the conference is to exchange ideas
on recent developments in preconditioning techniques for sparse linear
systems of equations, and to a lesser extent for eigenvalue
problems. Confirmed invited speakers are: Scott MacLachlan, Edmond
Chow, Jennifer Pestana, Stefano Serra-Capizzano, Frederic Nataf,
Ulrich Ruede, Vicki Howle, Stefan Vandewalle.
