This conference is a sequel to nine successful meetings on
preconditioning (one every two years), which address complex issues
related to the solution of general sparse matrix problems in
large-scale applications and in industrial settings. The goal of the
conference is to exchange ideas on recent developments in
preconditioning techniques for sparse linear systems of equations, and
to a lesser extent for eigenvalue problems. A forthcoming announcement
will provide details on focus areas and paper submission.
