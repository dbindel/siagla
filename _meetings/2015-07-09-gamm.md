The annual GAMM Workshop on Applied and Numerical Linear Algebra will
be held in Magdeburg, Germany, July 9-10 2015.

The special emphasis of the workshop is on "large-scale network
computations". But all other aspects of applied and numerical linear
algebra are most welcome.

Invited speakers (confirmed):

 - Michele Benzi (Emory, USA)
 - Ernesto Estrada (Strathclyde, UK)
 - Caren Tischendorf (HU Berlin, Germany)

The workshop will consist of three invited talks and contributed talks
of 25 minutes.
