PASC17 Conference: Papers, Minisymposia and Posters Submissions

The Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) is pleased to
announce that submissions will open on October 25 for the PASC17
Conference, co-sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM). Submissions are invited for papers, minisymposia and poster
presentations. PASC17 will be held from June 26 to 28, 2017, at the
Palazzo dei Congressi in Lugano, Switzerland.

PASC17 Conference  
June 26-28, 2017  
Palazzo dei Congressi  
Lugano, Switzerland  
<http://www.pasc17.org>

The PASC Conference is an interdisciplinary conference in high-
performance computing that brings together domain science, applied
mathematics and computer science - where computer science is focused
on enabling the realization of scientific computation.

TARGET AUDIENCE  
The PASC17 Conference invites participants from academia, research
laboratories and industry to discuss the state of the art in
computational science in the context of high-performance computing.
The conference is an opportunity for researchers in computational
science to present innovative research that can help address societal
challenges of today and the future.

PROGRAM  
The PASC Conference offers three days of stimulating and thought-
provoking technical sessions, including keynote presentations,
minisymposia, peer-reviewed papers, panels and poster sessions. The
conference is co-sponsored by ACM SIGHPC, and papers are published in
the ACM Digital Library.

CONTRIBUTIONS  
Researchers from academia and industry are encouraged to participate
and present their research in the form of papers, minisymposia and/or
posters. PASC17 welcomes submissions in the following scientific fields:  
- Climate and Weather  
- Computer Science and Mathematics  
- Emerging Domains (Special topic: HPC and Precision Medicine)  
- Engineering  
- Life Sciences  
- Materials Science and Chemistry  
- Physics  
- Solid Earth Dynamics  

PAPERS  
The goal of the PASC papers initiative is to advance the quality of
formal scientific communication between the relative disciplines of
computational science and engineering. Some disciplinary communities
traditionally publish in major, annual conferences, others primarily
in disciplinary journals, neither read regularly by the other
communities. PASC papers will enable the interdisciplinary exchange
in a manner bridging scientific publishing cultures and useful to the
individual and community research goals. Full submission guidelines
are provided through a separate call and are available
at http://www.pasc17.org/submission.
