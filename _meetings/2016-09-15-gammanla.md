Dear Colleagues,

The  
  
   16th GAMM Workshop Applied and Numerical Linear Algebra  
                 with special emphasis on  
       Linear Algebra Challenges in Machine Learning  
  
will take place at Hamburg University of Technology, September 15-16,
2016, Hamburg.

The plenary speakers are

  - Bart De Moor, KU Leuven, Belgium,  
 - Efstratios Gallopoulos, University of Patras, Greece,  
 - Philipp Hennig, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T&uuml;bingen, Germany.  

Talks related to Linear Algebra Challenges in Machine Learning and all
other areas of applied and numerical linear algebra are welcome.

Details of the workshop can be found at
