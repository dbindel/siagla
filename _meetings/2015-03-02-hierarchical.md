Hierarchical matrix techniques can be used to treat dense matrices
efficiently. Applications include

- the construction of preconditioners for elliptic PDEs,
- the discretization of integral operators,
- the evaluation of matrix functions and
- the approximation of solutions of matrix equations.

The key idea is to use a data-sparse representation of the dense
matrix and perform operations like the matrix-vector multiplication,
matrix multiplication, factorization or inversion preserving this
representation.

The winter school consists of lectures and exercises. The lectures
present the fundamental concepts of hierarchical matrices, e.g.,
compression techniques and algorithms for algebraic operations. The
exercises offer participants the opportunity to experience
hierarchical matrices in a number of applications, e.g., by
constructing an approximation of an integral equation or a
preconditioner for an elliptic PDE.
