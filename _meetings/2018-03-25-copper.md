The Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods, held every other
year, is the premiere conference on all aspects of iterative solution
methods and their applications. The meeting is organized in cooperation
with SIAM.

Highlighted topics for the 2018 meeting are:

* AMG for nonsymmetric systems
* Asynchronous iterative solvers
* Eigenvalue and singular value methods and applications
* Inverse problems, regularization
* Iterative methods in applications (earth systems, energy,
    fluids, electromagnetics, imaging)
* Iterative solvers at extreme scale and on high concurrency
    node architectures
* Iterative solvers for matrix equations
* Iterative solvers in data science and engineering
* Optimization of Complex Problems/Systems (PDE-constrained
    optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and
    uncertainty, and simulation-based optimization)
* Nonlinear solvers
* Randomized iterative solvers and preconditioners
* Rank-structured solvers and preconditioners
* Robust and scalable iterative solution of couple
    multi-physics problems
* Solvers for indefinite systems
* Surrogate modeling/model reduction
* Uncertainty quantification/PDEs with random data
