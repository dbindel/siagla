### SCOPE

MAT TRIAD provides an opportunity to bring together researchers sharing
an interest  in a variety of aspects of matrix analysis and its 
applications in other areas of science. Researchers and graduate 
students interested in recent developments in matrix theory and 
computation, spectral problems, applications of linear algebra in 
statistics, statistical models, matrices and graphs as well as 
combinatorial matrix theory are particularly encouraged to attend. The 
format of the meeting will involve plenary sessions, special sessions 
and  sessions with contributed talks posters. The conferences from MAT 
TRIAD series attract a number of international participants, provide a 
high quality scientific program as well as a friendly atmosphere for the 
discussion and exchange of ideas.

### SPECIAL ISSUE

A special issue of Applications of Mathematics will be published after 
the meeting, with the papers related to the talks presented during the 
conference.

### IMPORTANT DAYS

   The deadline for special session proposals is January 31, 2019.
   The deadline for registration and submission of abstracts is May 31,
2019.
