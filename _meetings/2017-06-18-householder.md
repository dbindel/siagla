The [Householder Symposium XX on Numerical Linear Algebra][1] will be held
at The Inn at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, USA, 18-23 June 2017.

This symposium is the twentieth in a series, previously called the
Gatlinburg Symposia, and will be hosted by the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University (VA Tech), in cooperation with the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the SIAM
Activity Group on Linear Algebra.

The Symposium is very informal, with the intermingling of young and
established researchers a priority. Participants are expected to
attend the entire meeting. The sixteenth Householder Award for the
best thesis in numerical linear algebra since 1 January 2014 will be
presented.

Attendance at the meeting is by invitation only. Applications will be
solicited from researchers in numerical linear algebra, matrix theory,
and related areas such as optimization, differential equations, signal
processing, and control. Each attendee will be given the opportunity
to present a talk. Some talks will be plenary lectures, while others
will be shorter presentations arranged in parallel sessions.

The application deadline will be some time in Fall 2016.

It is expected that partial support will be available for some
students, early career participants, and participants from countries
with limited resources.
