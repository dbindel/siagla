The Householder Symposium XX on Numerical Linear Algebra will be held
at The Inn at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, USA, 18-23 June 2017.  

Web page: <http://www.math.vt.edu/HHXX/>  
Application deadline: 31 October 2016  
Notification of acceptance: 15 February 2017  

Attendance at the meeting is by invitation only. Applications are
welcome from researchers in numerical linear algebra, matrix theory,
and related areas such as optimization, differential equations, signal
processing, and control. Each attendee will be given the opportunity
to present a talk or a poster. Some talks will be plenary lectures,
while others will be shorter presentations arranged in parallel
sessions.  

The Symposium is very informal, with the intermingling of young and
established researchers a priority. Participants are expected to
attend the entire meeting. It is expected that partial support will be
available for some students, early career participants, and
participants from countries with limited resources.  

The sixteenth Householder Award for the best PhD thesis in numerical
linear algebra (PhD earned between 1 January 2014, and 31 December
2016) will be presented. Nominations for the Householder Award are due
by 31 January 2017.  

The Householder Symposium takes place in cooperation with the Society
for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the SIAM Activity
Group on Linear Algebra.
