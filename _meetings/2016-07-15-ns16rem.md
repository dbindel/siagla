SUBMISSIONS: easychair.org/conferences/?conf=siamns2016

### KEYNOTE SPEAKERS:

Michelle Girvan, University of Maryland
Shang-Hua Teng, University of Southern California

### SCOPE

We invite contributions focused on all aspects of mathematical,
algorithmic, and computational techniques in network science.  Submit a
2-page abstract using the LaTeX style files provided at
siam.org/meetings/ns16/siam-wns-style.zip

Accepted abstracts will be posted online in late May 2016; authors will be
required to submit LaTeX source adhering to the template in April 2016.


### PRESENTATION FORMATS

The workshop will feature three formats for contributed presentations:
25-minute talks, 5-minute lightning talks in the "Ignite" format (5
minutes, 20 slides, 15-second auto-advance), and posters.  The program
committee will consider all submissions for all three presentation formats.

The Ignite format is new for NS'16; see www.ignitetalks.io for a
description.  We especially want to use this format to highlight work by
early-career researchers.  If you feel your submission is particularly
appropriate for an Ignite talk, please let us know using the checkbox on
the EasyChair submission page.
