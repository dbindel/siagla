Networks are emerging as a common language to model a wide variety of systems in life sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Real-world applications give rise to networks that are unstructured and often comprised of several components. Furthermore, they can support multiple dynamical processes that shape the network over time. The workshop will focus on processing and mining large-scale networks and is targeted for researchers and practitioners interested in data mining, machine learning, massive data analytics, network science, social networks and high performance computing in its broadest sense. Both theoreticians as well as practitioners, including system builders and individuals applying network analytic methods in application domains will be benefited from this workshop.

Papers are invited on topics including, but not limited to, the following:

- Network Analytics
  - Sequential, parallel distributed methods for computing structural properties of networks
  - Big data and networks
  - Parallel and distributed simulations of contagion processes over networks
  - Provable algorithms, rigorous heuristics for structural and dynamic analysis of networks
  - Empirical analysis of methods
  - Linear algebra and numerical analysis for mining networks
  - Fusion of heterogeneous data sources into a graph
  - Scalable heterogeneous graph stream mining
- Network Contagion, Control and Optimization
  - diffusion of information, innovations, ideas, beliefs over networks
  - emergence of norms
  - interventions to prevent contagion
  - influence maximization
  - Inference of network structure, contagions and pathways
- Game Theory in Social Networks and Social Contagion
  - influence maximization
  - influence blocking maximization game
  - other game-theoretic approaches
- Network Modeling
  - exponential random graph models
  - stochastic actor models
  - network evolution models, etc.
- Practical Applications of Networks
  - Real-world applications of networks in health, marketing, online media
  - Case studies in social behavioral and economic sciences
  - Description of large-scale systems to address network science problems
  - Social network analysis
  - Biological network analysis
  - Computer network analysis for cybersecurity

The full-day workshop will feature: invited talks, contributed talks, and a short session and/or a panel discussion on open problems and directions for future research. Papers that describe original and ongoing research as well as those that describe systems and tools are solicited.
