Registration is now open for the 27th Biennial Conference on Numerical Analysis  
June 27-30, 2017, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland

This long established conference is open to all researchers in the field, and you are invited to contribute a talk on your current work. Young researchers and PhD students will find the environment particularly welcoming. We are soliciting proposals for mini-symposia: these can be submitted on-line.

The following distinguished researchers have accepted invitations for
plenary lectures at the conference: Don Estep, Philip Gill, David Gleich, David Keyes, Christian Lubich, Ilaria Perugia, Gerlind Plonka-Hoch, Valeria Simoncini, Andrew Stuart, Endre S&uuml;li, Fran&ccedil;oise Tisseur, Karin Tornberg.

The A R Mitchell lecture will be given by Andrew Stuart and the Fletcher-Powell lecture by Philip Gill.
