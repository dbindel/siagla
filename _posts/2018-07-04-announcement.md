## <a name="nav3">Don't miss this unique opportunity at the 2018 SIAM annual meeting</a>

Dear Colleagues,

 
I want to bring your attention to a minisymposium that we are organizing at the 2018 SIAM annual meeting in Portland.  
In this workshop we hope to take concrete steps towards improving the climate in our departments and workplace.  
Please consider attending this workshop, and/or encouraging your colleagues to attend.  
If you've ever asked: "What can I do to help?", this workshop is for you.
Participants will receive a certificate of completion, and will be invited to engage in follow-up activities. 
Please forward the following announcement to anyone you think might be interested.
 
Minisymposium 30: Difficult Dialogues Workshop: How to Be a Better Ally, 
part of the SIAM annual meeting in Portland, is a unique opportunity to learn some practical tips on 
how to create a more inclusive environment in your department, workplace, or classroom. 
The workshop will be facilitated by Rebecca Renard-Wilson, an experienced facilitator who has been working
at the intersection of education, social justice, equity, and the arts for more than 20 years. 
While not required, we encourage you to come with a colleague to facilitate the implementation of 
ideas learned in the workshop.  Please email me at <aer04747@pomona.edu> with "How to be an Ally" 
in the subject line to indicate your intention to attend the workshop, or if you have any questions.  
You are welcome to just show up, but we do hope that you will attend the full two-hour workshop 
to get the most out of this interactive experience. 

A description of the workshop, which will be held on Monday, July 9, from 4-6PM can be found here:

Thank you for your help in making positive change -
