## <a name="nav0">Reflections on founding a new SIAM Student Chapter at TU Delft</a>

The following is a short piece from Manuel Baumann, 
the inaugural president of the TU Delft Student Chapter.

Dear SIAG/LA community,

I was offered to share some (personal) experiences 
with you about our [SIAM Student Chapter at Delft 
                    University of Technology](http://sscdelft.github.io/) 
which we founded in fall 2014. The story of our Chapter 
begins slightly earlier with so-called ba**NaN**a talks - 
a series of informal lectures *for-and-by* PhD students 
of the Numerical Analysis department. The talks cover 
software tools and practical aspects from the life of the 
(young) mathematical researcher. 
Based on this framework a small group of active PhD students 
founded the Student Chapter in Delft as the first one in 
The Netherlands. 
Throughout the whole process we got great support from our 
Faculty Advisors at TU Delft as well as from SIAM. 
For our *kick-off* meeting, we received this 
[video message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9dobJG-ttw) 
from the former SIAM president Irene Fonseca.

### Student Krylov Day 2015
From my point of view it is most feasible for a young 
Chapter to concentrate on one main yearly event. 
Biased by the research interests of our board, we decided 
to organize the 
[SIAM Student Krylov Day 2015](http://sscdelft.github.io/activities/2015/02/02/krylov-day.html). 
For this one-day workshop, we invited PhD students 
from other SIAM Chapters in Europe as well as from Dutch 
universities that we met during previous conferences. 
The day consisted of talks about theory and applications 
of Krylov methods by participating PhD students, 
and Peter Sonneveld from TU Delft gave a historical 
talk on IDR(s), a short-recurrence Krylov method developed 
in 2008. 
Pictures and more details can be found in an article in 
[SIAM News](https://sinews.siam.org/DetailsPage/tabid/607/ArticleID/504/European-Students-Gather-at-TU-Delft-for-Krylov-Day.aspx).

### Bi-monthly ba**NaN**a talks
Besides the main event, we organize regular so-called 
[ba**NaN**a talks](http://projectbanana.github.io/). 
This seminar differs from other talks in two aspects: 
Firstly, we usually meet after the official working day and, 
secondly, the presenters do not prepare a lot of slides but 
start a learning-by-doing session *live* with their laptops. 
The content of the talks cover a wide range of software tools 
that can be beneficial, especially for researchers in 
Numerical Linear Algebra:

- Version control with [git](https://git-scm.com), and efficient collaboration using [github](https://github.com) or [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org),
- How to use the [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) and [BLAS](www.netlib.org/blas/) libraries,
- Linking [Python](https://www.python.org/) with (fast) C/Fortran code,
- The new programming language [Julia](http://julialang.org),
- [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org) best-practice and reference management using [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net),
- The CFD open source tool [OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.com).

### Visit to TATA Steel
Since we are proper *applied* mathematicians, we also visited 
a Dutch steel company with the Student Chapter. 
A company visit gives a great opportunity to attract new 
members for the Student Chapter. 
In our case, we got the contact to TATA from a former 
collaborator of our group. The visit itself consisted of talks 
about numerical methods used at TATA and a tour through 
the steel factories.

### The social component
An important part of a SIAM Student Chapter is the social 
component. At the end of each academic year, we organize 
a BBQ on campus where all members and their families are 
invited. Moreover, we meet for movie nights showing movies 
with mathematical content such as *Enigma*, or 
*The Theory of Everything*. Overall, I met a lot of enthusiastic 
colleagues through the Student Chapter activities. 
If anyone considers to found a new SIAM Student Chapter 
at his/her university, please do not hesitate to ask us 
for more information!

## <a name="nav3">Postdoc and PhD positions in Parallel Computing for Extreme-Scale Systems</a>

Department of Computing Science at Umea University, Sweden invites 
excellent candidates to apply for postdoctoral and PhD positions. The 
successful candidate(s) will join NLAFET (Parallel Numerical Linear 
Algebra for Future Extreme-Scale Systems), which is one of the 
high-profile extreme-scale computing projects funded by the European 
Commission within the recent FET-HPC call under Horizon 2020. NLAFET is 
coordinated by Umea University with international partners from INRIA 
(France), University of Manchester and STFC-RAL (UK).

Future extreme-scale supercomputers will be heterogeneous and lead to 
new and challenging demands for efficient numerical algorithms and 
parallel software libraries. The aim of NLAFET is to tackle these 
challenges and ultimately deliver new scalable numerical libraries for 
fundamental problems in numerical linear algebra, including the solution 
of dense and sparse systems of equations and eigenvalue problems. 
Achieving this requires a co-design effort including developing novel 
algorithms, exploration of advanced scheduling strategies and runtime 
systems, offline and online autotuning, as well as avoiding 
communication and synchronization bottlenecks.

The positions will focus on design, implementation, and evaluation of 
parallel algorithms for matrix kernels and eigenvalue problems with 
regards to the extreme-scale challenges. The research will be done in 
close collaboration with recognized researchers and PhD students in the 
research group as well as with other partners in NLAFET.
