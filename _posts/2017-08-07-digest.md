The qualifying paper must contain significant research contributions to 
the field of linear algebra, as commonly defined in the mathematical 
literature, with direct or potential applications. The paper must have 
been published in English in a peer-reviewed journal in the four (4) 
calendar years preceding the award year. For the 2018 award, the paper 
must have been published between the dates of January 1, 2014 - December 31, 2017.

## <a name="nav2">Householder Symposium XXI, June 2020</a>

The Householder Symposium XXI on Numerical Linear Algebra will be held
at Hotel Sierra Silvana, Selva di Fasano (Br), Italy, 14-19 June 2020. 
Preliminary information can be found at

<http://users.ba.cnr.it/iac/irmanm21/HHXXI/index.html>

This symposium is the twenty-first in a series, previously called the
Gatlinburg Symposia, and will be organized in cooperation with the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the SIAM
Activity Group on Linear Algebra.

The Symposium is very informal, with the intermingling of young and
established researchers a priority. Participants are expected to
attend the entire meeting. The seventeenth Householder Award for the
best thesis in numerical linear algebra since 1 January 2017 will be 
presented.

Attendance at the meeting is by invitation only. Applications will be
solicited from researchers in numerical linear algebra, matrix theory,
and related areas such as optimization, differential equations, signal
processing, and control. Each attendee will be given the opportunity
to present a talk or a poster. Some talks will be plenary lectures, 
while others will be shorter presentations arranged in parallel sessions.

The application deadline will be some time in Fall 2019.

It is expected that partial support will be available for some
students, early career participants, and participants from countries
with limited resources.
