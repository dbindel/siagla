Several conferences of possible interest to SIAG-LA members were
announced this month on the SIAG-LA digest and NA-digest, including:

- [Structured Matrices and Tensors: Analysis, Algorithms, and Applications][1]
  in December 2014
- [SIAM Southeastern Atlantic Section Conference][2] in March 2015
- [Conference in honor of Volker Mehrmann][3] in May 2015
- [SIAM Workshop on Network Science][4] in May 2015
- [Precond 2015][5] in June 2015
- [CIME Summer School on Exploiting Hidden Structure in Matrix Computations][6]
  in June 2015
- [Sparse Days in France][7] in June 2015
- [SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications][8] in July 2015
- [Conference in honor of Nick Trefethen][9] in August 2015
- [Householder XX][10] in June 2017

In addition, the
[call for proposals for the Gene Golub SIAM Summer School][11]
has been posted.  Letters of intent are due by January 31, 2015.

Possibly interesting items from the web at large:

 - Cleve Moler explains in [two][logo1] [parts][logo2] the history of
   the MATLAB logo.
 - There was a Banff workshop on
   [Sparse Representations, Numerical Linear Algebra, and Optimization][banff]
   at the start of the month.  Dustin Mixon, one of the attendees
   [blogged][banff-blog] about the meeting.
 - Gil Strang has an article on [The Core Ideas in Our Teaching][strang]
   in the Doceamus section of the October issue of Notices of the AMS.
 - Birkhauser has released a
   [new book on the life of Andr&#233;-Louis Cholesky][cholesky].
 - In updating the SIAG-LA web site, I encountered a
   [report from 20 years ago][gilbert] on the 1994 SIAM LA conference.
   It's interesting to see how things change and how they remain the same.
 - The
   [November SIAG-LA digest](http://lists.siam.org/pipermail/siam-la/2014q4/000082.html)
   was posted on November 3; in addition to email, it is available online.
