## <a name="nav0">The SIAG/LA Officers seek input on a location for the 2021 SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra</a>


The deadline for submitting input has been extended to 16 February, 2018.

Recommendations for locations within North America need not have a
local organizing committee, but it would be helpful to provide
justification on why the particular recommended location is a good
choice for the SIAM ALA Conference. Such recommendations can be
sent directly to Jim Nagy, SIAG/LA Chair, <jnagy@emory.edu>.

Note that it is possible to run the conference with limited or no SIAM
support or staff, or to hold the conference outside North America.
However, in these situations it is important to have a strong local
organizing team, and a formal proposal needs to be submitted to SIAM.  
For further details, see:

<http://www.siam.org/meetings/proposals/siag_run.php>

The deadline for submitting recommendations and/or proposals
has been extended to 16 February 2018.

## <a name="nav2">C++ API for Batch BLAS</a>

As part of the ECP SLATE project, we are designing a standard C++ API for Batch
BLAS. We have published the initial draft of the proposed API as SLATE Working
Note #4:

<http://www.icl.utk.edu/publications/swan-004>

<http://www.icl.utk.edu/publications/series/swans>


Given the importance of such a standard, we would like to engage the broader
community in its development. To facilitate this collaboration, we have a SLATE
user mailing list. You can join this mailing list by going to the following URL:

<https://groups.google.com/a/icl.utk.edu/forum/#!forum/slate-user>

Once there, click the "Apply to join group" button. Please send any comments to
<slate-user@icl.utk.edu>

We look forward to a fruitful discussion and collaboration.

## <a name="nav4">Postdoc position at Tottori University in Japan for interdisciplinary research between information science and material science on supercomputers</a>

We would like to announce that an PD position in Japan is open
for interdisciplinary research between information science
(e.g. HPC, numerical analysis, data science)
and computational material science on supercomputers. [1]
The PD will join our team of
'Development of fundamental parallel algorithms' [2],
a part of the national project of Japan for development of
the next flagship ('post-K') supercomputer.

Starting date: April 1, 2018 (Later starting date is negotiable.)
Deadline: The review process will start immediately and continue
until the position filled. We may not guarantee the full consideration
for the application materials sent after 16. Feb. 2018.
Requirements: PhD degree. The researcher is expected to have
considerable experiences in computational material science (e.g.
electronic structure calculation, molecular dynamics simulation) or
information science (e.g. HPC, numerical analysis, data science).
Experience of the code development in Fortran and/or Python is
welcomed (not required). Other details can be found in [1].

## <a name="nav5">PhD/Postdoc Positions, Low-Rank Matrix Approximations, University of Mons</a>

The research group of Nicolas Gillis at the University of Mons (Belgium) is seeking highly qualified candidates for one doctoral and one postdoctoral position funded by the ERC (European Research Council). 

This project, entitled Constrained Low-Rank Matrix Approximations - Theoretical and Algorithmic Developments for Practitioners, focuses on the theory, algorithms and applications of low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data based on low-rank matrix approximations; see <https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasgillis/coloramap/overview> for a description of the project and the objectives. The successful candidate will have the flexibility to choose a topic within the range of this project. 

Your profile is a MSc/PhD in applied mathematics, mathematics, computer science, or a related discipline. You must have an expertise in at least one of these fields: optimization, computational complexity, numerical linear algebra, data mining and machine learning, hyperspectral imaging. You should have excellent programming skills in a numerical language (such as Matlab), and good communications skills, both written and oral, in English.

The positions remain open until they are filled. The starting date is flexible (ideally in September 2018). 

Please see <https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasgillis/coloramap/> for more details.
