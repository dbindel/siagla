SIAM News articles, SIAM Connect and SIAM blogs will soon come together 
at the [SIAM News Online](https://sinews.siam.org) site. 
This presents a great opportunity to showcase linear algebra activities and research to a much wider audience. 
If you have any interesting linear algebra news that you think
would be appreciated by a wider audience please don't hesitate to get in touch.

## <a name="nav0">New Book,  Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fifth Edition, by Gil Strang</a>

Announcing the May 2016 publication of this widely used textbook by Gilbert Strang :   
Introduction to Linear Algebra with new chapters on singular values and probability/statistics.

x + 574 pages / Hardcover / 978-09802327-7-6 / Wellesley-Cambridge Press
70.00 at <linearalgebrabook@gmail.com> and member price 67.50 at <http://siam.org/books>

I am writing to announce the new Fifth Edition of Introduction to Linear Algebra. 
This textbook is available from <http://siam.org/books> and from <http://math.mit.edu/linearalgebra> 
(which shows the Table of Contents and offers several sections to download). 
This is the book that goes with my video lectures on OpenCourseWare  <http://ocw.mit.edu>. 
It is the text for a large number of universities and colleges and now high schools.

 This edition has become more than a textbook. That will always be its first purpose. 
 The new Chapter 7 presenting the SVD along with Principal Components in finance and data analysis, 
 and Chapter 12 about Probability, make it also a text for a graduate course and a resource at work. 
 Linear algebra has become central in modern applied mathematics.  
 I hope you will look at the website math.mit.edu/linearalgebra and also at the 
 writing and the approach in the book itself.
