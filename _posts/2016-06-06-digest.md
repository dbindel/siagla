SIAM News articles, SIAM Connect and SIAM blogs will soon come together 
at the [SIAM News Online](https://sinews.siam.org) site. 
This presents a great opportunity to showcase linear algebra activities and research to a much wider audience. 
If you have any linear algebra news that you think
would be appreciated by a wider audience please don't hesitate to get in touch.

## <a name="nav0">NEW BOOK,  Introduction to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang, Fifth Edition, June 2016</a>

It is a pleasure to report the publication of this new edition.  
The first six chapters are the text for hundreds of math/CS/engineering departments 
(and increasingly also good high schools -- a positive sign in linear algebra's battle for 
a front seat beside calculus in math education). 

x + 574 pages / Hardcover / 978-09802327-7-6 / Wellesley-Cambridge Press
70.00 at <linearalgebrabook@gmail.com> and member price 67.50 at <http://SIAM.org/books>

The website <http://math.mit.edu/linearalgebra> shows the Table of Contents and offers six sections to download.
This is the book that goes with my video lectures for 18.06 on OpenCourseWare  <http://ocw.mit.edu>.

This edition has become more than a textbook. That will always be its first purpose -- the basic course 
develops bases for the Four Fundamental Subspaces (the column space and nullspace of A and A' )
The incidence matrices of graphs are outstanding examples -- and A'A is symmetric positive semidefinite.
Elimination for Ax=b and rank and projections and determinants and eigenvalues are central.

The new Chapter 7 presents the SVD along with Principal Components in finance and data analysis. Combined 
with Chapter 12 on Probability/Statistics this becomes a text for a graduate course and a resource at work.

My favorite graphs (below) show the singular values of two special matrices -- a triangular matrix L of 1's and  
the Hilbert matrix.  Notice the steep dropoff for hilb(40).  The singular values of L drop slowly and stop at 1/2 .

Linear algebra has become central in modern applied mathematics.  I hope you will look
at the website <http://math.mit.edu/linearalgebra> and also at the writing and the approach in the book itself.

## <a name="nav1">PMAA'16 Workshop - July 6-8, Bordeaux, France</a>

The 9th International Workshop on Parallel Matrix Algorithms and Applications (PMAA16) will be held in 
Bordeaux (France) and will run from July 6 to 8, 2016.

The program is now online at <http://pmaa16.inria.fr> and registrations are still open 
(thanks to sponsoring we succeeded to have no registration fee for PhD students).

Invited speakers  
- Cleeve Ashcraft (LSTC, Livermore) - An industrial perspective on new solvers  
- Costas Bekas (IBM, Switzerland) - HPC Frontiers in Cognitive Computing
- Thierry Deutsch (CEA, France) - Linear scaling method with Daubechies Wavelets for Electronic Structure Calculation
- Jack Dongarra (University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and University of Manchester) - Current Trends High-Performance Computing and Challenges for the Future  

We look forward welcoming you in Bordeaux in July!  
The PMAA'16 organizers
