## <a name="nav3"></a><a href="http://www.cec2019.org/">2019 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation</a>
Dear Colleague,

On behalf of the organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to invite you to the annual IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), which is one of the leading events in the area of evolutionary computation. IEEE CEC provides a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from all over the world to present and discuss their research findings on evolutionary computation.
 
IEEE CEC 2019 will be held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, New Zealand's national museum located in Wellington. Known as the "Coolest Little Capital", Wellington combines big city chic with small village charm, and is a fantastic conference destination to boot. As the country's cultural and creative hub, Wellington is home to industry leaders in high tech innovation and with the highest concentration of people employed in the information, communications and media sector. Connectivity between knowledge, technology and people drives Wellington's vision to be Smart Capital.
 
Wellington is renowned for its friendly locals and impeccable service. Wellingtonians absolutely positively believe in their city and that pride transcends into the services they provide. It offers a wide range of cosmopolitan amenities in downtown that is safe, clean, pedestrian friendly. Pulsing with packed cafes, bars, boutiques, galleries, public art and museums, the country's urban heart is a destination where all the best things in life come together.
