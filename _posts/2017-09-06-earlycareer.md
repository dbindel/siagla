We are excited to announce that the SIAG/LA has established an Early Career Prize to be awarded to an outstanding early career researcher in the field of applicable linear algebra.  

The prize will be awarded every three years at the SIAM Conference on Applied Linear Algebra, beginning with the meeting in Hong Kong, May 4-8, 2018.  Nominations for the 2018 prize must be submitted by November 1, 2017.  Nominees must be within six (6) years of receiving a PhD or equivalent degree as of January 1, 2018. Nominations should include a letter of nomination, including a description of the contributions, a CV of the candidate, and letters of support from two or three (but no more than three) experts.  Further details about the prize, including the prize selection committee and submission details will be posted on the SIAM website: <https://www.siam.org/activity/la/>.
