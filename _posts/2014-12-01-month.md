Several conferences of possible interest to SIAG-LA members were
announced this month on the SIAG-LA digest and NA-digest, including:

- [Precon 2015][1] in June 2015
- [MOPTA 2015][2] in July 2015
- [Domain Decomposition 23][3] in July 2015
- [MatTriad 2015][4] in September 2015

Also: the [Gene Golub SIAM Summer School on RandNLA][randnla] in June
2015 is now accepting applications.  The application deadline is
February 1, 2015.  And don't forget that there is a
[call for proposals for the next G2S3][g2s3call] out (letter of intent due
January 31, 2015)!

Possibly interesting items from the web at large:

- The recent [National Days of Computer Algebra][luminy] meeting
  in Luminy included short courses on
  [matrix structures and applications][bini]
  and [communication-avoiding LA algorithms][grigori].
- George Dantzig (Nov 8 1914-May 13, 2005) of linear programming fame 
  would have turned 100 this month.
  A [session in his honor][dantzig] was held at this month's
  INFORMS annual meeting in San Francisco.
- SIAM fall elections closed, and we [have a new board and council][siamnew].
- [Outreach in the Linear Algebra Community][siagla] appears
  on [SIAM Blogs][siamblogs].
- Ilse Ipsen on [Rolling the Dice on Big Data][ipsen].
- [Supercomputing 14][sc14] included many linear algebra talks.
- [Does UQ need efficient linear algebra?][silvester]
- Cleve Moler on MathWorks Logo: parts [3][logo3] and [4][logo4].
- [Etsy does matrix factorizations][etsy].
- Cayley to Sylvester:
  [I  have just obtained a theorem that appears to be very remarkable][cayley] (Nov
  19, 1857)
- New software: [Rational Krylov Toolbox for MATLAB][ratkry].
