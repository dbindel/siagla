The department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Strathclyde 
(<https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/mathematicsstatistics/>) is currently advertising two
fully funded, four year PhD scholarships in all areas of the mathematical sciences
(including statistics).  These scholarships are in the EPSRC framework for 'National 
Productivity Investment Fund 2018 training grant', and thus, candidates must be a UK
citizen, or a EU citizen fulfilling the EPSRC requirements.

The starting date of the scholarships is the 1st of October, 2018.

The selection process will be as follows:

1. Please, send a cover letter (including research interests), a detailed CV (including transcripts), and two reference letters, by email, to  Dr. Gabriel Barrenechea (<gabriel.barrenechea@strath.ac.uk>).  
2. After a ranking process (and possible interviews), two candidates will be chosen.  
3. These candidates will be given a number of projects to choose from, ranging over all the areas of applied mathematical sciences.

The deadline for applications is the 15th of June, 2018, and the results are expected to
be communicated on the 15th of July. 

For any inquires, please contact Dr. Gabriel Barrenechea, or Dr. Michael Grinfeld
