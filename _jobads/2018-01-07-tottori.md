We would like to announce that an PD position in Japan is open
for interdisciplinary research between information science
(e.g. HPC, numerical analysis, data science)
and computational material science on supercomputers. [1]
The PD will join our team of
'Development of fundamental parallel algorithms' [2],
a part of the national project of Japan for development of
the next flagship ('post-K') supercomputer.

Starting date: April 1, 2018 (Later starting date is negotiable.)
Deadline: The review process will start immediately and continue
until the position filled. We may not guarantee the full consideration
for the application materials sent after 16. Feb. 2018.
Requirements: PhD degree. The researcher is expected to have
considerable experiences in computational material science (e.g.
electronic structure calculation, molecular dynamics simulation) or
information science (e.g. HPC, numerical analysis, data science).
Experience of the code development in Fortran and/or Python is
welcomed (not required). Other details can be found in [1].
