**Virginia Tech Department of Mathematics Faculty Position in High Performance Computational Mathematics**

The Virginia Tech Department of Mathematics anticipates a tenure-track opening in High Performance Computational Mathematics with a start date of August 10, 2018, at our Blacksburg, VA, campus. The successful candidate will have a strong background in computational mathematics and high performance computing.  Possible specialties include, but are not limited to, mathematical aspects of numerical linear algebra, randomized numerical linear algebra, inverse problems, numerical PDE modeling, PDE solvers, uncertainty quantification, scientific computing, scalable data analytics, or large-scale topological data analysis. Application areas of interest include, but are not limited to, geophysics, physics, biology, or economics. 

The successful applicant will have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty across the university on the Intelligent Infrastructure for Human-Centered Communities Destination Area (<http://provost.vt.edu/destination-areas.html>). Priority areas of interest for this initiative include modeling, simulation, analytics, and decision-support environments that leverage modern high performance computing and big data for quantitative understanding of large-scale systems.

Appointment as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics is anticipated, but exceptional senior candidates will be considered for positions of Associate Professor of Mathematics or Professor of Mathematics. Teaching and service duties will be split between the Mathematics Department and the Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA) program. The CMDA program is a collaborative effort involving faculty members from several departments, coordinated by the College of Science's Academy of Integrated Science (<https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/index.html>). The college's Academy of Integrated Science and the university's Destination Areas are manifestations of Virginia Tech's commitment to its land-grant mission of using leadership in teaching, research, and service to address society's pressing problems. 

Job requirements include a Ph.D. in mathematics or a related field at the time of appointment. The successful candidate will be expected to establish a distinguished research program and to provide effective instruction and advising to a diverse population of undergraduate and graduate students, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the advanced high performance computing aspects of the Mathematics and CMDA curricula. Responsibilities include: continuing development of professional capabilities and scholarly activities, including travel to professional conferences; curriculum development; participation in department, college, and university governance; and professional service. Occasional travel will be required.
