The research unit NUMA, Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven invites applications for a full-time faculty position. The research unit develops numerical methods, algorithms, and software for simulation and data analysis, with applications in many fields in science and engineering. Research topics include numerical linear algebra, numerical methods for data analytics, model order reduction, control and optimization methods, multi-scale modelling and simulation, high performance computing, and uncertainty propagation.

The new position will complement the existing expertise on numerical methods and its applications of the NUMA Section, and will focus on new application modelling techniques and on new numerical algorithms and computational mathematics for Data Science. The position will aim at translating real-world problems to mathematical engineering models, and will be driven by practical applications and data-sets from the industry.
