PDEs (partial differential equations) arise in the mathematical modelling of many physical phenomena as well as science and engineering problems (meteorology, structural analysis, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, finance, etc.) Parallel solution schemes using state-of-the art computers allow scientists to obtain more representative and accurate solutions of the discretised equations faster. This increase in computational and modelling capabilities in turn encourages modelers and scientists to tackle harder problems, which need finer discretisations or more complex geometries. Among these problems, wave propagation in heterogeneous media and time harmonic regime (supposing an oscillatory behaviour in time of the solution) is particularly challenging and requires sophisticated methods. This project seeks to design, analyse, and implement fast, highly-parallel preconditioners for problems involving electromagnetic waves. The PhD researcher will have a substantial interaction with the postdoctoral researchers and scientists working in a recently awarded EPSRC grant between the Universities of Bath and Strathclyde, as well as with the industrial and academic international experts who are collaborating in this project.

Prerequisites: you should have (or expect to have) a UK Honours Degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics, Mathematics and Physics, or a closely related discipline with a high mathematical content. Knowledge of numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations and programming in usual scientific programming languages is desirable.

The candidates must be a UK citizen, or a EU citizen fulfilling the EPSRC requirements.
The starting date of the position should be on the 1st of October, 2018 or very soon after.
Funding: 4 year EPSRC scholarship.

Informal inquiries can be made to the supervisor: V. Dolean (<victorita.dolean@strath.ac.uk>)
