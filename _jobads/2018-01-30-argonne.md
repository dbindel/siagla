The Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division at Argonne National Laboratory is developing innovative techniques in numerical computing and computational mathematics. The Givens Associate program is intended to encourage graduate students who are beginning careers in numerical analysis or computational mathematics. Candidates must be in an accredited Ph.D. program in applied mathematics, computer science, computational science, statistics, or a related field at a U.S. university (U.S. citizenship is not required). 

Givens Associates will work actively with MCS scientists designing, analyzing, and implementing numerical and statistical algorithms.  For further information about particular applied mathematics, numerical software, and statistics research areas in MCS, see <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/group/applied-mathematics>.

The deadline for all application materials is March 1, 2018. Please see complete details at <http://www.anl.gov/education/graduates/givens-summer-associate-program>.
