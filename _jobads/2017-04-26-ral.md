We have an opening for a fixed-term, junior researcher to join the
Numerical Analysis Group at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,
near Oxford, England. The Group's main focus is on topics relating
to large-scale numerical linear algebra and optimization.

The position will involve undertaking novel independent and
collaborative scientific research at an international level in an
area of computational numerical analysis that is closely related
to the existing research interests of the Group. The role will also
contribute to developing, supporting and maintaining software within
the Group's key software projects (notably HSL, SPRAL and GALAHAD).

Further responsibilities will include developing national and
international research collaborations, working with colleagues on the
development and expansion of projects involving STFC scientific
facilities (notably the ISIS pulsed neutron and muon source, Diamond
Light Source and RAL Space), and the writing of grant applications to
secure future funding for numerical analysis research and software
development projects.
