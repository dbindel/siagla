The Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL, <http://icl.cs.utk.edu/>) at the University of Tennessee is looking for bright, motivated people to join our leading edge research team. The primary duties of this position are: to participate in the design, development and maintenance of numerical software libraries for solving linear algebra problems on large distributed memory machines with multicore processors and hardware accelerators; to help write research papers documenting research findings; to present the team's work at conferences; and to help lead students and research team in their research endeavors as related to ongoing and future projects. Given the nature of the work, there will be opportunities for publication, travel, and high profile professional networking in academia, labs, and industry. 
 
Joining this team will offer qualified candidates exciting career opportunities, such as participation in the Exascale Computing Projects (ECP) by the U.S. Department of Energy, such as SLATE (<http://icl.utk.edu/slate/>), PEEKS (<http://icl.utk.edu/peeks/>), xSDK (<http://www.icl.utk.edu/research/xsdk4ecp>), and others.

We encourage both fresh PhD graduates, as well as seasoned HPC veterans to apply. For more information, check out the job offer at
