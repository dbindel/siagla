A PhD position is available within the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. The project is entitled "Modern Numerical Linear Algebra for Huge-Scale Optimization Problems", and will be supervised by Dr John Pearson and Prof. Jacek Gondzio. Further details about this project are available at <https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=96733>.
  
The successful candidate will be fully funded by the School of Mathematics, including PhD fees, as well as a living stipend for 3.5 years, starting in September 2018 or an alternative date by mutual agreement. This studentship is available for all UK and EU students. 
 
This project is suitable for the University of Edinburgh?s PhD programmes in Applied and Computational Mathematics (<https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?r=site/view&id=511&cw_xml>), or Operational Research and Optimization (<https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?r=site/view&id=514&cw_xml>). Candidates are asked to submit their applications at one of these links, according to their programme of interest. All applications received by Friday 27 April 2018 will be considered. Applications received thereafter will be considered until the position is filled
