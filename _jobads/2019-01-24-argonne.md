The Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division at Argonne National Laboratory is developing innovative techniques in numerical computing and computational mathematics in its Laboratory for Applied Math, Numerical Software, and Statistics (LANS). Our Givens Associate program is intended to encourage graduate students who are beginning careers in numerical analysis or computational mathematics. 

Givens Associates will work actively with MCS scientists designing, analyzing, and implementing numerical, statistical, and learning algorithms.  For further information about applied mathematics, numerical software, and statistics research related areas in MCS, see <https://www.anl.gov/mcs/mathematics-and-computer-science-research>.

The deadline for all application materials is March 1, 2019 but applications will be processed starting February 1. Please see complete details at https://www.anl.gov/mcs/givens-associates .

Candidates must be in a Ph.D. program in applied mathematics, computer science, computational science, statistics, or a related field at a U.S. university (U.S. citizenship is not required).
