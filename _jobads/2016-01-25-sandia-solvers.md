Postdoctoral Appointee - Solvers for Emerging Architectures (Job ID: 652198)  
Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM

The Computational Mathematics Department is seeking a Postdoctoral Appointee with a focus on Solvers for Emerging Architectures.

Responsibilities include, but are not limited to (1) Conduct leading-edge research in Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods for advanced architectures in support of coupled multi-physics applications, 

(2) Software development and numerical experimentation, (3) Work as part of a multi-disciplinary team and to thrive in an expanding, fast-paced technical environment, (4) Collaborate with other 
staff members, (5) Travel as needed to support ongoing projects.

The Post-Doctoral Appointee Program is designed to recruit outstanding Ph.D. applicants to assist a line organization in meeting its mission objectives and to provide a professional technical work environment for the employee. The Ph.D. must have been conferred within five years prior to employment. These assignments are for a one-year period, with the option at management's discretion to serve no more than five additional one-year assignments.

Minimum Qualifications: (1) Ph.D. in physics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, or a related area received within 5 years prior to employment, (2) Demonstrated expertise in high performance numerical linear algebra, including parallel iterative solvers and/or multilevel preconditioners, (3) Research experience as evidenced by presentations, technical publications, released software, and/or work with applications

Desired Qualifications: (1) Strong C++ software development skills and experience utilizing component software for scientific software development, (2) Experience with Python and/or Matlab, (3) Experience with parallel programming such as MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and threaded programming models, (4) Experience in high-performance computing on distributed, parallel, and/or other specialized architectures (e.g., GPUs), (5) Interest in enabling solver technology within computationally challenging advanced simulations such as uncertainty quantification via stochastic partial differential equations, data-driven inverse problems, PDE-based optimization, and sophisticated multi-physics systems, (6) Ability to work in a collaborative research environment on problems comprising diverse application domains, (7) Excellent written and oral communication skills, (8) Ability to obtain and retain a Department of Energy security clearance preferred but not required

This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE)-granted security clearance.
