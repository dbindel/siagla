Applications are invited for a fully funded 3 year PhD studentship in numerical linear algebra, under the supervision of Dr Jennifer Pestana and Dr Alison Ramage, at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. The project will begin 1 March, 2018, or earlier by arrangement. 


**Summary**

Radial basis functions (RBFs) have several advantages when used to numerically approximate the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) in applications. However, solving linear systems that arise within RBF-based solvers is challenging. This project will develop and mathematically analyse new preconditioned iterative solvers of these linear systems, and will test their performance on interesting applications. 


**Project background**

Mathematical modelling is increasingly used to investigate and understand phenomena and forecast future events, particularly when experimentation is prohibitive or costly. However, real-world problems are often posed on complicated domains and involve scattered data, e.g. in geophysical and biological applications, or are inherently high-dimensional, e.g.\ in quantum physics, finance and systems biology. 

Complex geometry, scattered data and high dimensionality can be difficult for some numerical methods for PDEs to deal with. However, these problem features are handled  relatively easily by radial basis function approaches. RBF methods represent the solution of PDEs as a combination of radial basis functions that can be placed anywhere in the computational domain. The suitability of RBFs for complex problems is evidenced by their use in applications, including fluid flow, geophysics, plasma physics, finance and biology. 

Despite their advantages for dealing with complex, real-world problems, RBF methods can be difficult to implement. This is because obtaining the combination of radial basis functions that describes the PDE solution requires the solution of one or more challenging (i.e., ill-conditioned) systems of linear equations. 


**Project details**

This project will develop effective solvers for linear systems that arise in the numerical solution of PDEs by RBF-based approaches. In particular, we will focus on certain iterative methods (Krylov subspace methods) that start with an initial guess of the solution that is improved at each step. Since the rate of convergence of these methods depends on properties of the linear system, the focus of this project will be on developing equivalent linear systems for which convergence is faster; this process is known as preconditioning. At the core of this project will be the proposal, and analysis, of new preconditioners for RBF-based PDE solvers; this will combine mathematics with experimentation. 
The preconditioners will be tested on real-world applications. 


**Application details** 

Applicants should have or expect to obtain a good (I or II(i)) honours degree in mathematics or in a related discipline. This project would suit students with an interest in linear algebra and/or numerical analysis. Experience of numerical mathematics and/or programming would be beneficial, but is not essential. 

The successful applicant will be part of a vibrant postgraduate community, and will have access to a range of training opportunities, including the Scottish Mathematical Sciences Training Centre (<https://smstc.ac.uk/>). 

For more information please contact Dr Pestana (<jennifer.pestana@strath.ac.uk>). Formal application is via the University of Strathclyde postgraduate research application process at

Please ensure that you clearly state your interest in this project with these supervisors when making a formal application. 

For full consideration, please apply by January 15, 2018.

**Funding** 

The studentship covers UK/EU tuition fees and comes with an annual tax-free stipend at the standard UK rate. International students who can fund the difference between UK/EU and International fee rates are also encouraged to apply.
