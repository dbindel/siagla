Postdoctoral Appointee in Numerical Tensor Decompositions (Job ID: 652635)
Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA

We have openings for one or more postdoctoral researchers in numerical tensor decompositions. The researcher will be involved in developing new algorithms and improving existing tensor decompositions methods; in implementing high-performance parallel tensor decomposition software; and in interfacing with scientific, engineering, and analysis applications. The work will lead to fundamental advances for Sandia's customers and sponsors in the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies. The successful applicant will be expected to conduct innovative research, to develop open-source software, to present his or her findings at leading conferences and workshops, and to publish his or her results in leading journals. This postdoctoral position is for motivated and enthusiastic individuals with a background in applied mathematics, computer science, applied statistics, or related areas.

Minimum Qualifications: (1) Ph.D. in applied mathematics, computer science, applied statistics, or a closely related area, with a strong record of academic performance; (2) research experience in tensor decompositions, computational linear algebra, numerical data analysis, statistical data modeling, or other related topics; (3) refereed technical publications in mathematics, computer science, or statistics journals; (4) software development experience involving implementation and testing of numerical algorithms; and (5) excellent written and oral communication skills including experience giving technical presentations at professional conferences or workshops.

Desired Qualifications: (1) Previous research in one or more of the following areas: numerical linear algebra, numerical optimization, data analysis, randomized methods, or statistical modeling; (2) high-performance parallel computing experience; (3) internship or other experience in solving practical problems in science and engineering that involve encounters with real-world data; and (4) evidence of professional service to the community, such as engagement in student service activities or seminar/workshop organization.

The Post-Doctoral Appointee Program is designed to recruit outstanding Ph.D. applicants to assist a line organization in meeting its mission objectives and to provide a professional technical work environment for the employee. The Ph.D. must have been conferred within one to five years prior to employment. These assignments are for a one-year period, with the option at management's discretion to serve no more than five additional one-year assignments. This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE)-granted security clearance.
