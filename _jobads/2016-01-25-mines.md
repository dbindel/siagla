There is an immediate opening for a postdoc in Professor Paul Constantine's research group at Colorado School of Mines' Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. The position is part of a DARPA-funded project in collaboration with Stanford, University of Michigan, and Sandia National Labs on methods for uncertainty quantification in large-scale simulations. We are looking for someone with experience and interest in dimension reduction for large-scale uncertainty quantification and design. 

Qualifications: (i) PhD in computational mathematics or related discipline, (ii) experience with uncertainty quantification techniques, (iii) familiarity with high performance computing and large-scale simulation models

Compensation: 55k/year plus benefits

Term: one year renewable up to two years
