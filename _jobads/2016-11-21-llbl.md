Berkeley Labâ€™s Scalable Solvers Group in the Computational Research
Division has a couple of immediate openings for postdoctoral fellows
to design and implement highly parallel sparse matrix algorithms
targeted for the exascale. The candidate will participate in projects
to develop next-generation sparse factorization based algebraic solvers
and preconditioners, to integrate the new solvers into other higher
level algebraic solvers and high-end simulation codes, to analyze
algorithmic complexity and performance profile of the new algorithms
and codes, and to optimize the codes on emerging supercomputers built
from multi- and manycore processors.
