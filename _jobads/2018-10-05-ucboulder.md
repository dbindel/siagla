The Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at 
Boulder invites applications for two tenure track faculty positions at 
the Assistant Professor level to begin August 2019.

One position is in the area of computational mathematics, with possible
areas of emphasis including numerical analysis of differential 
equations, randomized numerical linear algebra, optimization and inverse 
problems, scientific computing, and related areas.

The other position is in the area of high dimensional data analysis (big 
data), with possible areas of emphasis including nonlinear optimization, 
analysis in high-dimensional spaces, randomized projections, 
probabilistic numerics, harmonic analysis, theoretical deep learning, 
and related areas.

For both positions, exceptional candidates in all fields of Applied 
Mathematics may be considered. Note that the most competitive candidates 
will have likely had postdoctoral training.

The candidate is expected to take an active role in undergraduate and 
graduate teaching, conduct a vigorous externally funded research 
program, advise graduate students, and participate in department and 
university governance.

For more details and to apply, please see (for the first and second 
positions, respectively):

Review of applications will begin on October 16, 2018; applications will 
be accepted until the position is filled.

Contact Stephen Becker, Daniel Appelo (chair of first search) or David 
Bortz (chair of second search) if you have any questions.
