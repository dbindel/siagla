The Scalable Solvers Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has 
two immediate job openings in matrix computation.  Successful candidates 
will join the group as career-track research scientists and will have 
excellent opportunities in conducting research and development in matrix 
computation, with an emphasis on high-performance computing on 
forthcoming extreme-scale computer architectures.  The successful 
candidates will also have opportunities to work in multi-disciplinary 
teams consisting of applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and 
domain scientists to work on the development and implementation of 
matrix algorithms that are targeted at the solution of scientific 
problems of interest to the U.S. Department of Energy.

The Scalable Solvers Group develops and implements state-of-the-art 
algorithms for solving large-scale algebraic systems, including, but not 
limiting to, systems of linear equations, systems of nonlinear 
equations, and eigenvalue problems, on massively parallel computer 
architectures.   Many of the algorithms are available and have been 
distributed in the form of software packages. By collaborating with 
domain scientists, the group applies the algebraic solvers developed to 
solve a variety of scientific problems that are central to the mission 
of the U.S. Department of Energy.  Information on the group is available 
at
