Applications are invited for a 3-year postdoctoral position as part of an EPSRC project in the area of numerical linear algebra for PDE-constrained optimisation problems, with applications to data science. The successful candidate will join the research group of Dr John Pearson in the School of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh.

The project is funded by the EPSRC Grant "Modern Linear Algebra for PDE-Constrained Optimisation Models for Huge-Scale Data Analysis", and by the University of Edinburgh. The successful candidate will contribute to the development of numerical methods and iterative solvers for huge-scale matrix systems arising from optimisation problems with PDE constraints, and will apply their techniques to cutting-edge problems from data science. Experience with PDE-constrained optimisation/inverse problems, and/or numerical methods for PDEs (including numerical linear algebra for solving matrix systems), is desirable. Expertise in a relevant programming language (e.g., Python, C++, MATLAB) is essential.

The position should be taken up in September 2019, or an alternative date by mutual agreement. Further particulars, as well as the application link, may be found at <tinyurl.com/ybu9qmur>.

Informal enquiries are encouraged, and may be made to John Pearson at <J.Pearson@ed.ac.uk>. The closing date for applications is 5pm on 22 January 2019.
