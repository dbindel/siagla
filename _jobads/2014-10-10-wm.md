Applications are invited for a postdoc position in the Computer
Science Department at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg,
VA, USA. This is funded by two NSF projects with overlapping
objectives; First to extend the PRIMME eigenvalue package (esp. toward
generalized eigenvalue and SVD problems). Second, to research variance
reduction mechanisms for the stochastic estimation of the trace of
functions of matrices (esp.  inverse and exponential). The research is
partly in collaboration with the Physics Department at W&M and the
DOE's Jefferson Lab.

Candidates should have a Ph.D. in a scientific computing area, strong
background in numerical linear algebra and high performance computing,
and good programming skills in C/C++. The position is for one year,
renewable for a second year based upon performance.

To apply submit a vita and the names of two references at
<https://jobs.wm.edu>, Position Number: F0842W.  Reviewing of
applications starts on October 20, 2014 and continues until the
position is filled.
