The Scalable Solvers Group in the Computational Research Division
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has an immediate
opening for a postdoctoral fellow in large-scale traffic
modeling. The candidate will participate in research projects
to develop algorithms and software to predict near-future
traffic flow from real-time measurements, and to help traffic
management centers to improve performance of road networks and
reduce congestion. The projects will focus on the problem of
identifying trends in traffic patterns measured either on the
freeway, on arterials, or both. Computational challenges include
issues of model calibration, confidence, size and fidelity,
real-time analysis, and model coupling. The research activities
will include evaluation of existing algorithms using real data,
development of new algorithms especially parallel algorithms for
handing larger datasets, and integration of the new algorithms
into various simulation models, at both research level and
production level. Deliverables will include both software
distributions as well as publications targeted at top-tier
research conferences and journals.
