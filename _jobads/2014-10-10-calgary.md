As a part of Collaborative Research Group on Optimization: Theory, Applications
and Algorithms
(<http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/collaborative-research-groups/optimization-theory-algorithms-and-applications-2012-2015>),
partly funded by Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS),
applications are invited for a post-doctoral position in optimization at
University of Calgary, Calgary AB Canada. The position is for 1-year, with
possible extension to 2 years, tentatively starting in Fall 2014 or Winter of
2015.

A successful candidate should hold or be close to completion of a PhD in
Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Operations Research or
related area.

Of primary interest are applicants interested in the following topics:

-       computational methods for solving conic optimization problems over p-cones, and/or
-       applications of optimization to optimal radiotherapy treatment planning, and/or
-       curvature of the central path.

Alternative PDF research proposals will also be considered.

The application documents, including research statement, short CV, and 3
reference letters, are to be submitted by email to Dr. Yuriy Zinchenko
(<http://people.ucalgary.ca/~yzinchen/>) at
`yzinchen@ucalgary.ca` with the subject
line "CRG PDF application".
