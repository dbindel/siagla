The newly established, interdisciplinary Research Training Group on 
"Differential Equation- and Data driven
Models in Life Sciences and Fluid Dynamic" (DAEDALUS) is a collaborative 
venture of the Technische Universit&auml;t
Berlin jointly with Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin and 
Otto-von-Guericke-Universit&auml;t Magdeburg.

The main goal of DAEDALUS is the analysis of the interplay between 
incorporation of data and differential
equation-based modelling, which is one of the key problems in 
model-based research of the 21st century.
DAEDALUS focuses both on theoretical insights and on applications in 
life sciences (brain-computer interfaces and biochemistry)
as well as in fluid dynamics. The projects cover a scientific range from 
machine learning, mathematical theory
of model reduction and uncertainty quantification to respective 
applications in turbulence theory, simulation of complex
nonlinear flows as well as of molecular dynamics in chemical and 
biological systems. Detailed project descriptions can
be found under

[www.daedalus.berlin](http://www.daedalus.berlin).

DAEDALUS also offers collaborative supervision from leading 
international scientists, embedded in one of the most
dense and innovative academic regions in Europe.

Requirements: Successfully completed university degree (Master, Diploma 
or equivalent) in Computer Science, Engineering,
Mathematics, Physics or other related disciplines; an excellent command 
of English, together with good academic
writing and presentation skills.

We are looking for highly motivated, inquisitive, enthusiastic, and 
result-driven PhD candidates with an excellent academic
record and strong interest in interdisciplinary scientific work.
