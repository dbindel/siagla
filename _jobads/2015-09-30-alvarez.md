The Computational Research Division, the National Energy Research
Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and the Scientific Networking
Division at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory invite applications for the 2016 Luis W. Alvarez Fellowship
in Computational Science. The fellowship allows recent graduates with
a Ph.D. (or equivalent) to acquire unique scientific training at one
of the leading facilities for scientific computing and to develop
professional maturity for self-directed independent research.

The fellowship provides opportunities to work on some of the most
important research challenges in computing sciences, from the
architecture and software of next generation high performance
computing systems and networks, to mathematical modeling, algorithms,
and applications of advanced computing to astrophysics, cosmology,
chemical sciences, materials science, climate change, biology and
other scientific domains.  The successful candidate will be able to
interact and collaborate with Berkeley Lab researchers that develop
and apply the latest technologies to computational modeling,
simulation, and data analytics for scientific discovery.

The position offers a competitive salary and excellent benefits.
