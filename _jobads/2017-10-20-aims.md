Applications are invited for the DAAD funded postdoctoral fellowship in Data Science at AIMS South Africa under the supervision of Dr Bubacarr Bah, the German Research Chair for Data Science. The research area will be Data Science (in a very broad sense). For further details see: <https://www.aims.ac.za/en/opportunities/vacancies/postdoctoral-fellowships> 

Applications will be submitted through the DAAD portal found here: <https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?origin=136&status=2&subjectGrps=C&daad=1&q=postdoctoral%20fellowship&page=1&detail=57407689#bewerbung%20> 

PLEASE NOTE: In recognition of the higher cost of living in South Africa compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries, the salary offered by DAAD will be topped-up by AIMS South Africa and the amount of top-up will be negotiated with the candidate.
