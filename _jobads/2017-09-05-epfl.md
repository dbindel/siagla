The Chair of Numerical Algorithms and High-Performance Computing
([anchp.epfl.ch](http://anchp.epfl.ch)) is inviting applications for a postdoctoral
researcher. The research project focuses on the development, analysis,
and application of low-rank matrix and tensor methods.

Candidates are expected to have a strong background in numerical
linear algebra. Preference will be given to candidates with demonstrated
experience in low-rank approximation, randomized algorithms and/or
high-performance computing.

The position is available from January 1, 2018 but there is flexibility.
The initial appointment is for two years with the possibility of extension.
Some minor teaching responsibilities will be expected.

Applications will be considered until the position is filled.

Applicants should prepare a CV and a list of 3 references that can be
contacted. This should be forwarded as a single PDF file to Mrs Samantha
Bettschen (<samantha.bettschen@epfl.ch>).

Questions about the position or requests for further information can
directed to Prof Daniel Kressner (<daniel.kressner@epfl.ch>).

EPFL is an equal opportunities employer and places particular emphasis
on fostering career opportunities for women. Qualified women are
therefore strongly encouraged to apply.
