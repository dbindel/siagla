The research group Theory and Applications of Algorithms at the 
University of Vienna (UV) and the research group Parallel Computing at 
Vienna University of Technology (TU) have three openings for PhD 
students (two of them at UV, one at TU) in a joint research project on 
resilient and fault tolerant algorithms in numerical linear algebra 
(with co-PIs Wilfried Gansterer and Jesper Larsson Traeff).

All positions require a first-rate Master or Dipl.-Ing. degree in 
computer science, computer engineering, or a closely related field with 
a focus on algorithms and data structures, discrete mathematics and 
linear algebra, computer systems, parallel computing, and programming. 
Moreover, strong analytical skills, solid software development and 
programming skills, parallel computing experience (shared and/or 
distributed memory, programming models, interfaces, algorithms), 
demonstrated written and oral communication skills, effective 
interpersonal skills, a background in high performance computing (HPC), 
in dense numerical linear algebra, and in fault-tolerance for parallel
and distributed computing systems are required. The working language is 
English.

Each position is for three years. Expected starting date is March 1st, 
2016. Applications received by January 15th, 2016 will receive full 
consideration.
