Candidates with background in all areas of data science and mathematics for industry are encouraged to apply. However, candidates with strong track record in optimization, operations research or computational statistics would be a particularly good fit for the research being currently conducted in the school. 

1. [Whittaker Research Fellow in Mathematics for Data Science](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/jobs/wrfdata). Candidates should have a track record of research developing new mathematical or statistical methods for the analysis and processing of large-scale datasets. 
2. [Whittaker Research Fellow in Mathematics for Industry or Business](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/jobs/wrfindustry). Candidates should have a track record of reseach in mathematics with demonstrable impact on industry or business (understood in their broadest sense). 
3. [William Gordon Seggie Brown Research Fellowship](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/jobs/seggiebrown2014). The successful fellow will pursue world-class research as well as contributing to the teaching activity of the School.
