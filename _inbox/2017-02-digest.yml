      Announcing the December 27, 2016, publication by SIAM of:  
      **MATLAB Guide, Third Edition**  
      Desmond J. Higham and Nicholas J. Higham  

       MATLAB is an interactive system for numerical computation that is widely used for teaching and research in industry and academia. It provides a modern programming language and problem solving environment, with powerful data structures, customizable graphics, and easy-to-use editing and debugging tools.

      This third edition of MATLAB Guide completely revises and updates the best-selling second edition and is more than 25 percent longer. The book remains a lively, concise introduction to the most popular and important features of MATLAB and the Symbolic Math Toolbox.

      Key features are a tutorial in Chapter 1 that gives a hands-on overview of MATLAB, a thorough treatment of MATLAB mathematics, including the linear algebra and numerical analysis functions and the differential equation solvers, and a web page at http://www.siam.org/books/ot150 that provides a link to example program files, updates, and links to MATLAB resources.

      The new edition contains color figures throughout, includes pithy discussions of related topics in new â€œAsides" boxes that augment the text, has new chapters on the Parallel Computing Toolbox, object-oriented programming, graphs, and large data sets, covers important new MATLAB data types such as categorical arrays, string arrays, tall arrays, tables, and timetables, contains more on MATLAB workflow, including the Live Editor and unit tests, and fully reflects major updates to the MATLAB graphics system.

      ** Audience **  
      This book is suitable for both beginners and more experienced users, including students, researchers, and practitioners.

      ** About the Authors**  
      ** Desmond J. Higham** is 1966 Chair of Numerical Analysis at the University of Strathclyde, UK. His research focuses on stochastic computation, network science, and city analytics. He is a SIAM Dahlquist Prize winner, a SIAM Fellow, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
