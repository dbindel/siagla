      The deadline for submitting input has been extended to 16 February, 2018.

      Recommendations for locations within North America need not have a
      local organizing committee, but it would be helpful to provide
      justification on why the particular recommended location is a good
      choice for the SIAM ALA Conference. Such recommendations can be
      sent directly to Jim Nagy, SIAG/LA Chair, <jnagy@emory.edu>.

      Note that it is possible to run the conference with limited or no SIAM
      support or staff, or to hold the conference outside North America.
      However, in these situations it is important to have a strong local
      organizing team, and a formal proposal needs to be submitted to SIAM.  
      For further details, see:
