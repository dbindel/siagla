      Iâ€™d like to share news of a Special Issue Call for Papers on "Mathematics and Motherhood" for the [Journal of Humanistic Mathematics](http://scholarship.claremont.edu/jhm/). View the Call for Papers [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ihgbu065rius592/Call4SpecialIssue.pdf?dl=0). Abstract submissions are due October 1, 2017 and initial submission of complete manuscripts is due January 1, 2018.

      This special issue of Journal of Humanistic Mathematics will explore the intersectionality of mathematics and motherhood with the aim of empowering more women in mathematics to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences and the professoriate. The issue will feature articles, autobiographical stories, poetry, and essays from a diverse set of women who have found success and balance in their mathematics career and motherhood.

      I hope you will consider submitting an abstract.

      Best,

      Pamela E. Harris, Ph.D.
      Assistant Professor
      Department of Mathematics and Statistics
